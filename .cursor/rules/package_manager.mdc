# Package Manager

Always use Bun instead of npm or yarn for package management. This includes:
- Installing dependencies: `bun install` instead of `npm install`
- Running scripts: `bun run` instead of `npm run`
- Adding dependencies: `bun add` instead of `npm install`
- Running the dev server: `bun dev` instead of `npm run dev`

Rationale:
- Bun is significantly faster than npm
- Bun is the officially supported package manager for this project
- Using Bun ensures consistent behavior across all developers
- The project's package.json and lockfile are managed by Bun
