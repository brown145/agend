# Node.js Version

Always use Node.js version 23.1.0 for this project. This version is managed through asdf.

To ensure you're using the correct version:
1. Make sure asdf is installed
2. Run `asdf shell nodejs 23.1.0` before starting development
3. Verify the version with `node --version`

Rationale:
- The project is built and tested against Node.js 23.1.0
- Using a different version may cause compatibility issues
- asdf ensures consistent Node.js versions across all developers
- The project's dependencies and features may not work correctly with other versions
