# UI Component Conventions

## Component Structure
- Use shadcn/ui components as the base UI library
- Place reusable components in the `components/ui` directory
- Keep page-specific components in their respective page directories

## Data Fetching
- Components can use `useParams` and `useParamIds` directly
- Components can perform their own data fetching and mutations
- Exception: Components in the `/ui` directory should not perform data fetching

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the project's color scheme and design system
- Use consistent spacing and sizing variables

## State Management
- Use React's built-in state management (useState, useReducer)
- Use Convex hooks for data fetching and mutations
- Keep component state local when possible

Rationale:
- shadcn/ui provides a consistent and accessible component library
- Direct data fetching in components simplifies the codebase
- Consistent styling improves user experience
- Local state management reduces complexity
